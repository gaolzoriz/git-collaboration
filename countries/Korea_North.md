North Korea shares the Korean language with South Korea, although some dialect differences exist within both Koreas. North Koreans refer to their Pyongyang dialect as munhwa ("cultured language") as opposed to South Korea's Seoul dialect, the p'yojuno ("standard language"), which is viewed as decadent because of its usage of Japanese and English loanwords

Words from Japanese, Chinese or Western origin have been eliminated from munhwa along with the usage of Chinese hancha characters. Written language uses the chos≈èn'gul phonetic alphabet, developed under Sejong the Great
